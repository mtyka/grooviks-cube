Django + hookbox + python controller.
Solution which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Three parts:
Controller: Standalone python process which understands cube logic, motion, etc
Hookbox: Comet pub/sub message queue which pushes messages to clients with very low latency
Django: Web app server which serves the HTML, javascript and supports hookbox.
