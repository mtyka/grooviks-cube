Django + hookbox + python controller.
Solution which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Three parts:
Controller: Standalone python process which understands cube logic, motion, etc
Hookbox: Comet pub/sub message queue which pushes messages to clients with very low latency
Django: Web app server which serves the HTML, javascript and supports hookbox.

How To Run
----------
SUMMARY: Install stuff, and try runall.sh.

 0. Install a bunch of stuff...
   - Use python 2.6 if you can.  2.5 will likely complain about simplejson.
   - First install "easy_install" by visiting http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
   - Then use easy_install to install a bunch of stuff.  On mac you'll need to run "sudo easy_install".  On PC I think it's just "easy_install"
   - sudo easy_install hookbox
   - sudo easy_install pyjsiocompile
   - sudo easy_install django 
     or if you don't get v1.2
     follow instructions at http://www.djangoproject.com/download/
     [Check by running python and then 
      >>> import django
      >>> django.VERSION
      (1, 2, 1, 'final', 0)
     ]

 1. In terminal 1: Run "./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080"
 2. In terminal 2: Run "hookbox -d -r bakonv8 -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080"
    [Note that hookbox sometimes logs an OSError about a missing egg, but runs anyway.]
 3. In terminal 3: Go to ../pacsci and run "./groovikhookbox.py"
 4. In Chrome: open http://localhost:8080


Where is the cube code?
-----------------------
The HTML and javascript are all in the templates/ directory
