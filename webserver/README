Django + hookbox + python controller.
Solution which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Three parts:
Controller: Standalone python process which understands cube logic, motion, etc
Hookbox: Comet pub/sub message queue which pushes messages to clients with very low latency
Django: Web app server which serves the HTML, javascript and supports hookbox.

How To Run
----------

 0. Install a bunch of stuff...
   - Use python 2.6 or python 2.7. Older or newer versions dont seem to work.
   - First install "easy_install" by visiting http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
   - Then use easy_install to install a bunch of stuff.  On mac you'll need to run "sudo easy_install".  On PC I think it's just "easy_install".
     You can also use pip (in which case the commands change to 'sudo pip install xyz==1.2.3')
    sudo easy_install hookbox==0.3.3
    sudo easy_install pyjsiocompile==0.2.3
    sudo easy_install pyserial==2.6
    sudo easy_install django==1.4.5 

    
 1. In terminal 1: Run "./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080"
 2. In terminal 2: Run "hookbox -d -r bakonv8 -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080"
        -If you get "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory" ignore it -- everything's fine.
 		-If the restkit module is giving you problems (module reventlet not found) try 
		manually downloading restkit 2.2.3 instead of the newer 2.3xxx
 	
 3. In terminal 3: Go to ../controller and run "./groovikhookbox.py"
 4. In Chrome: open http://localhost:8080


Where is the cube code?
-----------------------
The HTML and javascript are all in the templates/ directory
