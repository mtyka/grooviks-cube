This directory has the code that will run on a single machine and drive all views 
of the cube in the pacific science center.

There will be multiple processes running on this machine.  
One is a web server which serves HTTP requests for the web clients.  This will
run the django code.  It synchronizes requests through an in-memory database.

Another process is called "main_simulation_loop.py".  This process pushes display
commands out to all the clients, including the web clients and the arduinos.


** Software pre-requisites **

Before running the system, you need the following software installed on your machine:

Python 2.6 - http://www.python.org/download/
Django 1.2 - http://www.djangoproject.com/download/
Sqlite3 3.6 - http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

Newer versions will probably work fine. But for python I'd stick with 2.7 and not try 3.


** Running the system **

To start the web server process, run this command:

    python manage.py runserver

To start the main loop running, first set up some environment variables:
(on Mac...)
    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=djangocube.settings
    export PYTHONPATH=..:$PYTHONPATH

(on Windows something like...)
    set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=djangocube.settings
    set PYTHONPATH=..:$PYTHONPATH

And then run the loop itself:

    python main_simulation_loop.py


Then open any modern web browser (Chrome works best. Firefox or Safari fine) to:
    http://localhost:8000/

You should see a cube with random colors that change periodically.
