A web solution for the cube which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Hookbox is an HTTP publish/subscribe service.
It relies on a web application, which is written in django and lives in ../onecube.


How To Run
----------
SUMMARY: Install stuff, and try runall.sh.

DETAILS: It's a bit of a p.i.t.a. right now, sorry about that.  It can be made easier if you're willing
to deal with worse performance by switching to a hosted hookbox, but that isn't set up yet.

 0. Install hookbox and Quixote using some or all of the following steps
   - Install easy_install http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
   - easy_install hookbox
   - easy_install pyjsiocompile
   - easy_install django

 1. In terminal 1: Go to ../onecube and run "./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080"
 2. In terminal 2: `hookbox -d -r bakonv8 -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080`
 3. In terminal 3: Go to ../pacsci and run "./groovikhookbox.py"
 4. In Chrome: open http://localhost:8080



Where is the cube code?
-----------------------
The file formerly "index.html" is now split up in ../onecube/templates 
starting with cube.html which includes the others.
