A web solution for the cube which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Hookbox is an HTTP publish/subscribe service.
It relies on a web application, which is written in "quixote" here and does nothing useful but is needed anyway.

random_colors.py shows how to push messages out.


How To Run
----------
It's a bit of a p.i.t.a. right now, sorry about that.  It can be made easier if you're willing
to deal with worse performance by switching to a hosted hookbox.

 0. Install hookbox and Quixote using some or all of the following steps
   - easy_install hookbox
   - easy_install quixote
   - easy_install pyjsiocompile (hookbox depends on this).

 1. In terminal 1: `./webapp.py`
 2. In terminal 2: `hookbox -d -r bakonv8 -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080 --cbpath=`
 3. In terminal 3: `./random_colors.py`
 4. In Chrome: open http://localhost:8080


Details
-------

Uses hookbox server running on localhost:2974
data published on channel "chan1".

A producer process (producer.py) generates random data and uses
Hookbox's REST api to publish the data on the channel mentioned above.

A Quixote based web application (webapp.py) serves the main page and also
handles call backs from the Hookbox process.
