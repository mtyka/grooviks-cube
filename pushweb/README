A web solution for the cube which achieves very low latency using comet-style http push.

Hookbox is an HTTP publish/subscribe service.
It relies on a web application, which is written in "quixote" here and does nothing useful but is needed anyway.

random_colors.py shows how to push messages out.


How To Run
----------
SUMMARY: Install stuff, and try runall.sh.

DETAILS: It's a bit of a p.i.t.a. right now, sorry about that.  It can be made easier if you're willing
to deal with worse performance by switching to a hosted hookbox, but that isn't set up yet.

 0. Install hookbox and Quixote using some or all of the following steps
   - Install easy_install http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
   - easy_install hookbox
   - easy_install quixote
   - easy_install pyjsiocompile

 1. In terminal 1: `./authapp.py`
 2. In terminal 2: `hookbox -d -r bakonv8 -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080 --cbpath=`
 3. In terminal 3: `./random_colors.py`
 4. In Chrome: open http://localhost:8080



Details
-------

The 'authapp' is listening on port 8080
It will respond to requests from non-local clients.
It serves the index.html file up with the client code.
It also contains trivial authorization logic necessary for hookbox for work. 
Later this process will manage authorization for clients.
It's a written in quixote.

Uses hookbox server running on localhost:2974.

The random_colors.py process sends random colors down the 'iframe' channel.
