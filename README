Home of the groovikscube software v2.
This is the web-based version of the software for installation at the
Pacific Science Center.

The directories are as follows:

pushweb/ - Web UI using hookbox for http pub/sub.
    Preferred and most bestest way of doing things.  
    Check README for how to run, or try runall.sh

pacsci/ - a port of the "server" code which ran in the belly of the playa cube
    groovikhookbox.py is the current best version.  This is the main "server" process
    

onecube/ - a django project to handle multiple web clients connecting to a single cube.
    This will replace a bunch of the code in pushweb/
