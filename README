Home of the groovikscube software v2.
This is the web-based version of the software for installation at the
Pacific Science Center.

The directories are as follows:

onecube/ - a django project to handle multiple web clients connecting to a single cube.
    Preferred and most bestest way of doing things.  
    Code hosted at www.theonecube.com

pacsci/ - controller logic code.  Formerly referred to as "server" code, a term which is now horribly ambiguous.
    This is a port of the code which ran in the belly of the playa cube.
    groovikhookbox.py is the current best version.
