Home of the groovikscube software v2.
This is the web-based version of the software for installation at the
Pacific Science Center.

The directories are as follows:

webserver/ - A django project to handle multiple web clients connecting to a single cube.
    Web UI for the cube.  Soon to be deployed at pacsci.  Hosted at http://cube.leodirac.com/

controller/ - Controller logic code.  Formerly referred to as "server" code, a term which is now horribly ambiguous.
    This is a port of the code which ran in the belly of the playa cube.
    groovikhookbox.py is the current best version. This must be running along with the webserver and hookbox.
