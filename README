Home of the groovikscube software v2.
This is the web-based version of the software for installation at the
Pacific Science Center.

The directories are as follows:

djangocube/ - Web server which servers pages with htmlrenderer.
   This should be the target of all integration and considered the best working copy
   of everything moving forwards.

pacsci/ - a port of the "server" code which ran in the belly of the playa cube
   (to be merged into djangocube/ by the Brians)

htmlrender/ - standalone Canvas display in HTML + javascript 
   (obsolete. Already merged into djangocube.)

push-experiment/ - a playground for trying HTTP push technologies
   (to be merged into djangocube by Leo)
